The repository is a user-defined class that deals with the storage and manipulation of data.

Modules used are datetime, os, math, and csv

__init(self)__
The only item initialised as of now is the name of the file used.

createFile()
This function creates a file if it doesn't exist, and then overwrites the file if it already does.

Once the file is opened in write mode (with the csv module), the writer object is initialised. The headings for each column
(though they are techincally not required for function, they are present for testing) are written and the file is closed.

removeFile()
This function uses the os module to check if the file exists, and delete it if it does.

addTomatoData()

computeDates()
This function generates a dictionary where the key-value set is the Serial Number and the amount of days in storage.

Once the file is opened in read mode (with the csv module), the reader object is initialised. Skipping the first row,
the reader object is then iterated over, and a timedelta object is created, which can be used to find the number of days
in storage.
